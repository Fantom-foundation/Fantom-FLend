# Fantom FLend DeFi module

The repository implements fLend module of the Fantom DeFi smart contracts
in Solidity based on [Andre Cronje's](https://github.com/andrecronje/flend)
implementation.

Please note we use
[OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts)
library version 2.5 along with the Solidity 0.5 and truffle
to conform with the EVM implemented in the Opera block chain.
Consult the [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com)
documents to find out how to build and deploy
the smart contract implemented here.

In general, all you should need to do is to call `truffle build`
to get the deployable contract code and ABI inside `build/` folder.
